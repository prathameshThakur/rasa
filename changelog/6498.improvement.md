Adding configurable prefixes to Redis [Tracker](./tracker-stores.mdx) and [Lock Stores](./lock-stores.mdx) so that a single Redis instance (and logical DB) can support multiple conversation trackers and locks.
By default, conversations will be prefixed with `tracker:...` and all locks prefixed with `lock:...`. Additionally, you can add an alphanumeric-only `prefix: value` in `endpoints.yml` such that keys in redis will take the form `value:tracker:...` and `value:lock:...` respectively.
