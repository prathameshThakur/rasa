Slot mappings for [Forms](forms.mdx) in the domain are now optional. If you do not
provide any slot mappings as part of the domain, you need to provide
[custom slot mappings](forms.mdx#custom-slot-mappings) through a custom action.
A form without slot mappings is specified as follows:

```rasa-yaml
forms:
  my_form:
    # no mappings
```

The action for [forms](forms.mdx) can now be overridden by defining a custom action
with the same name as the form. This can be used to keep using the deprecated
Rasa Open Source `FormAction` which is implemented within the Rasa SDK. Note that it is
**not** recommended to override the form action for anything else than using the
deprecated Rasa SDK `FormAction`.
