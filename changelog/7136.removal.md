The [`Policy`](policies.mdx) interface was changed to return a `PolicyPrediction` object when
`predict_action_probabilities` is called. Returning a list of probabilities directly
is deprecated and support for this will be removed in Rasa Open Source 3.0.

You can adapt your custom policy by wrapping your probabilities in a `PolicyPrediction`
object:

```python
from rasa.core.policies.policy import Policy, PolicyPrediction
# ... other imports

def predict_action_probabilities(
        self,
        tracker: DialogueStateTracker,
        domain: Domain,
        interpreter: NaturalLanguageInterpreter,
        **kwargs: Any,
    ) -> PolicyPrediction:
    probabilities = ... # an action prediction of your policy
    return PolicyPrediction(probabilities, "policy_name", policy_priority=self.priority)
```

The same change was applied to the `PolicyEnsemble` interface. Instead of returning
a tuple of action probabilities and policy name, it is now returning a
`PolicyPrediction` object. Support for the old `PolicyEnsemble` interface will be
removed in Rasa Open Source 3.0.
